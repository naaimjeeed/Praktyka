            <p>What you should already know</p>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
             <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW)</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The JavaScript documentation on MDN includes the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic scripting with JavaScript provides structured JavaScript guides for beginners and introduces basic concepts of programming and the Internet.</li>
                <li>JavaScript Guide (this guide) provides an overview about the JavaScript language and its objects.</li>
                <li>JavaScript Reference provides detailed reference material for JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). 
                There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files 
                (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser),
                 JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <pre>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing 
                numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides 
                dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions 
                can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether 
                methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <header>Functions</header>
            <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 
                To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
            <p>The function square takes one parameter, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the parameter of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself.
                 The return statement specifies the value returned by the function, which is number * number.</p>
            <p>arameters are essentially passed to functions by value — so if the code within the body of a function assigns a completely new value to a parameter that was passed to the function, 
                the change is not reflected globally or in the code which called that function.</p>
            <p></p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Expressions_and_operators">
            <header>Expressions and operators</header>
            <p>This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

            At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) 
            and those that purely evaluate.

            The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

            The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. 
            However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const z = 3 + 4), 
            its result will be immediately discarded — this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects.</p>
            <code>const x = 1 + 2 * 3;</code>
            <code>const val = 0;</code>
            <code>const foo = ["one", "two", "three"];</code>
            <code>const [one, two, three] = foo;</code>
